            <li>When ready to cook, remove dough from fridge and allow to come up to room
                temperature. Preheat oven to 500F</li>
            <li>Lightly oil your pan and roll dough out to about a 12 inch circle</li>    
            <li>Puree crushed tomatoes and spread evenly over the pizza dough.</li>
            <li> Spread both cheeses evenly over the sauce, and bake for 10-12 minutes.</li>
